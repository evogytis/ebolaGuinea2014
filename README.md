##Phylogenetic analysis of 2014 Ebolavirus outbreak in Guinea.

This repository contains three alignments in the nexus format:
- `ebolavirus_cds.nex` - contains 7 concatenated protein coding sequences from 49 ebolavirus genomes.
- `ebolavirus_intergenic.nex` - contains concatenated non-coding sequences from 49 ebolavirus genomes.
- `ebolavirus_raw.nex` - contains 49 aligned complete ebolavirus genomes.

These alignments were used to make trees seen in Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 in a [PLOS Currents Outbreaks paper](http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/phylogenetic-analysis-of-guinea-2014-ebov-ebolavirus-outbreak-2/) by @rambaut and I.
