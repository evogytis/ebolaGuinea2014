@article{minin2008,
	Abstract = {Kingman's coalescent process opens the door for estimation of population genetics model parameters from molecular sequences. One paramount parameter of interest is the effective population size. Temporal variation of this quantity characterizes the demographic history of a population. Because researchers are rarely able to choose a priori a deterministic model describing effective population size dynamics for data at hand, nonparametric curve-fitting methods based on multiple change-point ({MCP)} models have been developed. We propose an alternative to change-point modeling that exploits Gaussian Markov random fields to achieve temporal smoothing of the effective population size in a Bayesian framework. The main advantage of our approach is that, in contrast to {MCP} models, the explicit temporal smoothing does not require strong prior decisions. To approximate the posterior distribution of the population dynamics, we use efficient, fast mixing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms designed for highly structured Gaussian models. In a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed temporal smoothing method, named Bayesian skyride, successfully recovers ``true'' population size trajectories in all simulation scenarios and competes well with the {MCP} approaches without evoking strong prior assumptions. We apply our Bayesian skyride method to 2 real data sets. We analyze sequences of hepatitis C virus contemporaneously sampled in Egypt, reproducing all key known aspects of the viral population dynamics. Next, we estimate the demographic histories of human influenza A hemagglutinin sequences, serially sampled throughout 3 flu seasons.},

	Abstract = {Computational evolutionary biology, statistical phylogenetics and coalescent-based population genetics are becoming increasingly central to the analysis and understanding of molecular sequence data. We present the Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees ({BEAST)} software package version 1.7, which implements a family of Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} algorithms for Bayesian phylogenetic inference, divergence time dating, coalescent analysis, phylogeography and related molecular evolutionary analyses. This package includes an enhanced graphical user-interface program called Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis Utility ({BEAUti)} that enables access to advanced models for molecular sequence and phenotypic trait evolution that were previously available to developers only. The package also provides new tools for visualizing and summarizing multi-species coalescent and phylogeographic analyses. {BEAUti} and {BEAST} 1.7 are open-source under the {GNU} lesser general public license and available at http://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com and http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk.},

@article{wittmann2007,
	Abstract = {Over the last 30 years, Zaire ebolavirus ({ZEBOV)}, a virus highly pathogenic for humans and wild apes, has emerged repeatedly in Central Africa. Thus far, only a few virus isolates have been characterized genetically, all belonging to a single genetic lineage and originating exclusively from infected human patients. Here, we describe the first {ZEBOV} sequences isolated from great ape carcasses in the {Gabon/Congo} region that belong to a previously unrecognized genetic lineage. According to our estimates, this lineage, which we also encountered in the two most recent human outbreaks in the Republic of the Congo in 2003 and 2005, diverged from the previously known viruses around the time of the first documented human outbreak in 1976. These results suggest that virus spillover from the reservoir has occurred more than once, as predicted by the multiple emergence hypothesis. However, the young age of both {ZEBOV} lineages and the spatial and temporal sequence of outbreaks remain at odds with the idea that the virus simply emerged from a long-established and widespread reservoir population. Based on data from two {ZEBOV} genes, we also demonstrate, within the family Filoviridae, recombination between the two lineages. According to our estimates, this event took place between 1996 and 2001 and gave rise to a group of recombinant viruses that were responsible for a series of outbreaks in 2001--2003. The potential for recombination adds an additional level of complexity to unraveling and potentially controlling the emergence of {ZEBOV} in humans and wildlife species.},

@article{guindon2003,
	Abstract = {The increase in the number of large data sets and the complexity of current probabilistic sequence evolution models necessitates fast and reliable phylogeny reconstruction methods. We describe a new approach, based on the maximum-likelihood principle, which clearly satisfies these requirements. The core of this method is a simple hill-climbing algorithm that adjusts tree topology and branch lengths simultaneously. This algorithm starts from an initial tree built by a fast distance-based method and modifies this tree to improve its likelihood at each iteration. Due to this simultaneous adjustment of the topology and branch lengths, only a few iterations are sufficient to reach an optimum. We used extensive and realistic computer simulations to show that the topological accuracy of this new method is at least as high as that of the existing maximum-likelihood programs and much higher than the performance of distance-based and parsimony approaches. The reduction of computing time is dramatic in comparison with other maximum-likelihood packages, while the likelihood maximization ability tends to be higher. For example, only 12 min were required on a standard personal computer to analyze a data set consisting of 500 rbc L sequences with 1,428 base pairs from plant plastids, thus reaching a speed of the same order as some popular distance-based and parsimony algorithms. This new method is implemented in the {PHYML} program, which is freely available on our web page: {http://www.lirmm.fr/w3ifa/MAAS/.}},

@article{sanchez1993,
	Abstract = {Sequence analysis of the second through the sixth genes of the Ebola virus ({EBO)} genome indicates that it is organized similarly to rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses and is virtually the same as Marburg virus ({MBG).} In vitro translation experiments and predicted amino acid sequence comparisons showed that the order of the {EBO} genes is: 3'-{NP-VP35-VP40-GP-VP30-VP24-L.} The transcriptional start and stop (polyadenylation) signals are conserved and all contain the sequence 3′-{UAAUU.} Three base intergenic sequences are present between the {NP} and {VP35} genes (3′-{GAU)} and {VP40} and {GP} genes (3′-{AGO}, and a large intergenic sequence of 142 bases separates the {VP30} and {VP24} genes. Novel gene overlaps were found between the {VP35} and {VP40}, the {GP} and {VP30}, and the {VP24} and L genes. Overlaps are 20 or 18 bases in length and are limited to the conserved sequences determined for the transcriptional signals. Stem-and-loop structures were identified in the putative (+) leader {RNA} and at the 5' end of each {mRNA.} Hybridization studies showed that a small second {mRNA} is transcribed from the glycoprotein gene, and is produced by termination of transcription at an atypical polyadenylation signal located in the middle of the coding region. The predicted amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein contains an N-terminal signal peptide sequence, a hydrophobic anchor sequence, and 17 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. Alignment of predicted amino acid sequences showed that the structural proteins of {EBO} and {MBG} contain large regions of homology despite the absence of serologic cross-reactivity.},

@article{carroll2013,
	Abstract = {Viruses in the Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus genera (family Filoviridae) have been associated with large outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in human and nonhuman primates. The first documented cases occurred in primates over 45 years ago, but the amount of virus genetic diversity detected within bat populations, which have recently been identified as potential reservoir hosts, suggests that the filoviruses are much older. Here, detailed Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analyses are performed on 97 whole-genome sequences, 55 of which are newly reported, to comprehensively examine molecular evolutionary rates and estimate dates of common ancestry for viruses within the family Filoviridae. Molecular evolutionary rates for viruses belonging to different species range from 0.46 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year for Sudan ebolavirus to 8.21 × 10−4 nucleotide substitutions/site/year for Reston ebolavirus. Most recent common ancestry can be traced back only within the last 50 years for Reston ebolavirus and Zaire ebolavirus species and suggests that viruses within these species may have undergone recent genetic bottlenecks. Viruses within Marburg marburgvirus and Sudan ebolavirus species can be traced back further and share most recent common ancestors approximately 700 and 850 years before the present, respectively. Examination of the whole family suggests that members of the Filoviridae, including the recently described Lloviu virus, shared a most recent common ancestor approximately 10,000 years ago. These data will be valuable for understanding the evolution of filoviruses in the context of natural history as new reservoir hosts are identified and, further, for determining mechanisms of emergence, pathogenicity, and the ongoing threat to public health.},
